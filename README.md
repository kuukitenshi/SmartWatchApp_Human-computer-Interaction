# SmartWatch Aplication

This project was a collaborative effort with other studenta collegue for our ```Human-Computer Interaction``` subject.

The project's objectives was to create an ```interface for a smartwatch aplication``` using ```JavaScript, HTML and CSS language```.

Through this project, we enhanced our knowledge of designing a good interface, focus on ```accessibility, aesthetics, and functionality```. 

Our goal was to develop a ```friend-meeting application to manage events```. To achieve this, we initially created Low-Fidelity Prototypes and Storyboards. Subsequently, we progressed to a first Functional Prototype, receiving and making Heuristic Analyses for other groups to enhance our interface. These step led us to the final Functional Prototype. The entire journey is detailed and illustrated in a ```presentation.pdf```, which documents the necessary steps to achieve our goal.

It's worth to refer that our interface is ```fully functional```, in other words, the screens are linked and it incorporates web storage, simulating ```real-word of application usage scenario```.

Finally, all of our hard work resulted in a ```perfect score```.
